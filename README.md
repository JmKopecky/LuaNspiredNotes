Lua-based notes for the TI-Nspire CAS calculator. 

Lua script can be added to a calculator page (.tns file), transforming that page's menu into an interface to access the notes. When a page is selected, text is rendered to the screen. Accessing another page through the menu clears the previous text and replaces it with the new text relevant to that page.
